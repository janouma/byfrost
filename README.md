# Bifrost

A web components micro builder that transforms components from various source formats into optimized, production-ready JavaScript modules.

## Overview

Bifrost is a suite of tools designed to compile and optimize web components from multiple frameworks into lightweight, minified JavaScript modules. At its core, Bifrost enables you to write components in your preferred framework (Svelte, Vue â€“ and more by providing the right adapter) and compile them into framework-agnostic web components ready for production deployment.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Multi-Framework Support**: Compile components from Svelte, Vue â€“ and other formats via adapters
- **Intelligent Asset Handling**: Automatic copying and URL rewriting for static assets
- **Advanced Module Mapping**: Flexible import rewriting and dependency resolution
- **Production Optimization**: Automatic minification â€“ and optional (beta) source maps
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for adding new source formats
- **Caching System**: Optional caching for improved build performance
